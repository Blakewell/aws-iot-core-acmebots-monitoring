# Acme Bots

Acme Bots offers robotics services for customers in several industries, such as (but not limited to) entertainment, security, oil & gas, building, retail and manufacturing.

Customers contract bots from a vast array of options, such as sub-sea, terrestrial and drone bots. For example, oil & gas customers uses terrestrial bots to automate their warehouse and supply-chain operations. Sub-sea bots are used to inspect operations that take lace on deep water well sites and drone are used to inspect miles of mid-stream pipelines.

Every single Acme Bots contract has availability SLAs. In order to make sure there are no customer disruptions and that customers are operating the bots according to their requirements, every single bot sends a lot of telemetry data to AWS IoT and can also accept remote commands. This also enables AcmeBots to have historical data about every single device in order to make software and hardware improvements and also optimize preventive maintenance.
